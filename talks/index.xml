The workshop&amp;rsquo;s aim was to bring together the contributors and users of Enzyme in particular, and people interested in automatic differentiation within the LLVM infrastructure in general, for two days of fast-paced high-bandwidth idea exchange and collaboration bootstrapping. For this the workshop was designed to have a flexible format, friendly to practitioners and researchers alike; its program consisted of a mix of presentations, tutorials, roundtable discussions and live programming sessions.</description></item></channel></rss>
