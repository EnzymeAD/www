## About

The first [Enzyme workshop](https://enzyme.mit.edu/conference) took place from February 22-24 in Boulder, Co. The workshop's aim was to bring together the contributors and users of Enzyme in particular, and people interested in automatic differentiation within the LLVM infrastructure in general, for two days of fast-paced high-bandwidth idea exchange and collaboration bootstrapping. For this the workshop was designed to have a flexible format, friendly to practitioners and researchers alike; its program consisted of a mix of presentations, tutorials, roundtable discussions and live programming sessions.
