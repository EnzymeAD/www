## Enzyme builds successfully but won't run tests

Double check that Enzyme's build can find lit, LLVM's testing framework. This can be done by explicitly passing lit as an argument to CMake as described [here](/Installation).

## Enzyme is Crashing

LLVM's plugin infrastructure is broken in many versions. Empirically LLVM 8 and up will often incorrectly disallow memory from being passed between LLVM and a plugin. If you see one of these errors and want to use the same version of LLVM try passing the flag `enzyme_preopt=0` described [here](/getting_started/UsingEnzyme). The flag disables preprocessing optimizations that Enzyme runs and tends to reduce these errors. If this doesn't work, check the following.

### Illegal TypeAnalysis on LLVM 10+

There is a [known bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47612) in an existing LLVM optimization pass (SROA) that will incorrectly generate type information from a memcpy. This bug has been fixed in LLVM 13

### opt can't find -enzyme option

When you use opt command like below:
`
opt input.ll -load=/path/to/LLVMEnzyme-VERSION.so -enzyme -o output.ll -S
`
opt reports a error:`opt: unknown pass name 'enzyme'`

May be because you are using  LLVM 13 or a higher version, which has switched to the new pass manager pipeline. On applicable LLVM versions (up to and including LLVM 15),
you can specify that opt useees the old pass manager by adding the `--enable-new-pm=0` flag. Alternatively, you can use the new pass manager, which uses the following syntax
for opt:

`
opt input.ll -load=/path/to/LLVMEnzyme-VERSION.so -passes=enzyme -o output.ll -S
`

Simiarly, clang has different syntax for plugins for the new pass manager. On LLVM versions up to and including LLVM 12, this is done as follows:
`
clang -Xclang -load -Xclang /path/to/ClangEnzyme-VERSION.so code.c
`

On LLVM 13 and above, the new pass manager is the default. If you would like to continue to use the old pass manager, you will also need to provide
either `-fno-experimental-new-pass-manager` on versions below 14, or `-flegacy-pass-manager` on LLVM 14 or 15. LLVM 16 and above dropped support for the legacy pass
manager entirely.

To use the new pass manager, the following command line args are required for Clang:
`
clang -fpass-plugin=/path/to/ClangEnzyme-VERSION.so code.c
`

### UNREACHABLE executed (GVN error)

Until June 2020, LLVM's exisitng GVN pass had a bug handling invariant.load's that would cause it to crash. These tend to be generated a lot by Enzyme for better optimization. This was reported [here](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46054) and resolved in master. Options for resolving include updating to later verison of LLVM with the fix, or disabling creation of invariant.load's.
